# Elisabet Hein Portfolio

👋 Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio website - my very own learning playground where I took my first real dive into React and started sharpening my frontend skills with TypeScript.

What started as a beginner project has blossomed into a space that showcases who I am: a final-year Computer Science student, passionate Full-Stack Developer in the making, and an AI enthusiast. It’s not perfect - yet - but it’s a snapshot of my growth, my experiments, and my journey so far!

## What can you find here?

* My tech stack ⛏ - What I’m comfortable with and what I’m exploring.

* Projects 📚 - From AI-driven thesis work to web apps and creative coding experiments.

* Contact info & social links 📫 - Because networking is key!

* About me 💪 - Fun facts, quirks, and a peek into what drives me beyond code.

* A fun, clean UI ✨ - Designed with simplicity and style in mind, sprinkled with playful UI touches and my favorite colors.

* Downloadable CV 📝 - Grab my CV right from the sidebar anytime!

## What's next?

* Adding a backend to make the site dynamic - no more hardcoded content!

* Building a personal admin panel to effortlessly update experiences, projects, and skills without touching the code.

* Continuing to level up with TypeScript and more advanced React concepts.
