            Iâ€™m Elisabet Hein - currently in my final year of Computer Science at the University of Tartu! I love coding, especially anything to do with full-stack development or AI, and Iâ€™m always curious to try new tech and build cool stuff.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-4'>
            Iâ€™ve worked on all kinds of projects - from backend systems and APIs to fun data science experiments and UI/UX designs. Learning and growing are super important to me, whether thatâ€™s picking up a new framework or figuring out how to make things work better.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-4'>
            Outside of code, I like staying active (hello gym life ðŸ’ª), exploring new places, and occasionally diving into arts and crafts. Welcome to my page - feel free to look around!
